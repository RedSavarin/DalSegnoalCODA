What is Solatorobo: Dal Segno al CODA?

Salut! And welcome to Solatorobo: Dal Segno al CODA!

    What is Little Tail Bronx?

Little Tail Bronx is a series of games developed by CyberConnect2 set in a world of floating sky islands populated by two species, Caninu (dog people) and Felineko (cat people). [Tail Concerto (PS1, 1998), Solatorobo: Red The Hunter (DS, 2010), Mamoru-kun (Safety-awareness PSA series made for Fukuoka Prefecture in Japan), Little Tail Story (Mobile, 2014-2015), Strelka Stories (Cancelled) and the upcoming Fuga: Melodies of Steel.]

    What is Solatorobo?

Solatorobo is an action RPG/visual novel on the DS developed by CyberConnect2 and released in 2010. The game pushed the DS(i) to its very limits, featuring polygonal 3D, cutscenes, and a brilliant score. Despite this, it was still limited by the technology of the time, having a very basic combat system, fixed camera angles and tiny pixelated NPC sprites. And this remake will be attempting to address all of these issues.

Planned Features

    First 2 parts remade from the ground up in HD with a modern 3D game engine (Unity Engine)

    Some new quests based off the novellas (more information in the Discord server)

    Reworked mechanics (lookin at you, clunky combat and flying)

    Locations expanded and fully realized in semi-open world 3D (no more loading in between tiny areas)

We plan to focus on releasing parts 1 and 2 first, chapter by chapter, all for free. If you’re having trouble imagining what it’ll be like, just think of it being like how the Final Fantasy 7 Remake was compared to the original, but with less budget.

    Assistance Needed!

The project is currently in the preproduction phase and we are a tiny group that can only work on it as a hobby in our spare time. Given the massive scope of the project, it will take years - if not decades - to complete at our current pace.

We are especially looking for:

    Anyone with game dev and Unity/Unreal experience.

    Writers - Mainly for the new additions to the story and fixing inconsistencies in writing.

    Musicians - For new tracks and new arrangements of old tracks.

    Artists/3D modelers - For concepting, character/mech designs, textures, etc.

    Translators - Translating the artbooks and sourcebooks for canon compliance.

Even if you do not have much experience in the previous list, do not be afraid to come to the server. Any help at all is appreciated, even if it’s just something like help mod the server or organize things or advertise the project.

Additionally, if there is enough interest we may open a Patreon for the sole purpose of hiring artists and modelers and programmers.

    CC2's general stance on the project

As of this post being made, CC2 has said that they have no plans remaking or remastering the game in the near-medium future, which is why this project exists. CC2 has also stated that they are fine with fangames and fan art in a recent Hiroshi Q&A. While we have not had any communication with CC2 in any way, it seems that they are at least aware of the project (one of the game directors has followed the account that made the tweet announcing the project).
